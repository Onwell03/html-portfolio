<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a junior at Alabama State University majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. As a computer 
  science major, I have always been passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems and positively impact 
  society. This passion has driven me to continuously seek new opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills.</p>

<p>Throughout my academic journey, I have been fascinated by the power of algorithms and data structures to optimize and 
  automate processes. In my coursework, I have learned the fundamentals of computer science, including programming
  languages, software engineering, and computer systems, and I have applied these concepts to various projects that have 
  challenged me to think critically and creatively. For example, I took a class with CodePath of Introduction to Mobile
  Development and during the course, I created a Flash Card application that displays questions and allows the user to 
  answer the question and then provide the answer at the end. This course helped me learn the basis of Kotlin language 
  and Android Studio.</p>

<p>In addition to my technical skills, I am a highly motivated and detail-oriented individual who is always seeking to 
  improve my abilities. I am a quick learner and can adapt to new environments and challenges. I am also an effective 
  communicator, both verbally and in writing, and I am comfortable working in a team environment..</p>
